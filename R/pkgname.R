#' Psychometrics for gifted and talented program identification
#'
#' This package contains a suite of functions for exploring the psychometrics of one- and
#'   two-stage identification systems. A set of functions for understanding the conditional
#'   distribution of ability scores for identified students are available. Further, given
#'   a set of scores from identified students, program characteristics such as sensitivity
#'   and the incorrect identification rate (e.g., 1-PPV) can be estimated with bootstrapped
#'   uncertainty.
